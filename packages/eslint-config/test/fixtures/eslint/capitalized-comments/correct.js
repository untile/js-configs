// Rule: capitalized-comments correct usage

// Example 1: Basic capitalized comment
// This is a properly capitalized comment

// Example 2: Multiple lines
// Each line starts with a capital letter
// Like this one here

/* Example 3: Block comment
 * This is a capitalized block comment
 * Each line starts with a capital
 */

// Example 4: Consecutive comments with ignoreConsecutiveComments option
// This first comment is capitalized
// this one can be lowercase because it's consecutive
// and this one too

// Example 5: Code with capitalized comments
const foo = () => null;

foo();
// This explains the code above

// Example 6: Documentation comment
/**
 * This is a documentation comment
 * Each line is properly capitalized
